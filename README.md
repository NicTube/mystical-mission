# Mystical Mission Source Code

PM: Mystical Mission Source - based on the repository for making Paper Mario mods using Star Rod ([download here](https://discord.gg/papermario)).

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nanaian/star-rod-mod
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/NAME_OF_PATCH
```

Extra patches will not merge ("refusing to merge unrelated histories") if you [generated](https://github.com/nanaian/star-rod-mod/generate), rather than forked, this repository. In this case, manually cherry-pick the commits you want.
